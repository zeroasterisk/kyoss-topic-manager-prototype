This is a **prototype** for the
[KYOSS Topic Manager](https://github.com/KYOSS/kyoss-topic-manager)
which we plan to use at
[KYOSS](http://kyoss.org/).

The **real** Topic Manager we want to use as a platform for discussing and demonstrating Agile Development practices,
collaborating with a team, discussing workflow, etc..

The GitHub project for this prototype is here:<br>
[github.com/zeroasterisk/kyoss-topic-manager-prototype](https://github.com/zeroasterisk/kyoss-topic-manager-prototype.git)

The Meteor hosted playground url:<br>
[kyoss-topic-manager-prototype.meteor.com](http://kyoss-topic-manager-prototype.meteor.com)

It was written in [MeteorJS](http://meteor.com)
by [Alan Blount](http://zeroasterisk.com/)
during a [JsLou](http://jslou.org) *"hack night"*.

This **prototype** is functional (for now), and expresses my vision of a basic featurset and basic functionality.

Sadly it is an example of *Cowboy Programming* and probably derails the Agile Development we are attempting to demonstrate.

As such, we need to discuss how this will affect the project going forward and if we are "ok" with this prototype's existance.

1. We can "abandon" it.
2. We can "adopt" it, and start working on is as the real project.
3. Or we can "use and reference it" as a playground, to inform our work on the real project (which is how it was intended)
