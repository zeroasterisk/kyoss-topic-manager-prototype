# This is a Prototype

We have a **real** project for the
[KYOSS Topic Manager](https://github.com/KYOSS/kyoss-topic-manager)

This one is a prototype I created to communicate my ideas for the application
and to have something "quick and dirty" to work with.
*( sadly, cowboying and possibly breaking Agile :( )*

### How To Develop Locally

*(Sorry Windows users... use Linux or OSX)*

1. install NodeJS (if needed) [here](http://nodejs.org/download/)
2. install [MeteorJS](https://meteor.com) (if needed) `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`
3. install [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/) (if needed, extra package manager for Meteor) `npm install -g meteorite`
4. fork the project in GitHub
5. clone your fork locally
6. cd into your clone
7. install all packages `mrt install`
8. run locally `mrt`
9. view at `http://localhost:3000`

Assuming no problems, here are all commands you need:

```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
$ npm install -g meteorite
$ git clone ..... myfork
$ cd myfork
$ mrt install
$ mrt
```
